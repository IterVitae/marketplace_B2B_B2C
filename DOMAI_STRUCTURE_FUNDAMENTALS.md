## üîí Compliance & Security First

We are building a platform of trust. Our architecture is designed to be **GDPR-compliant by design, not by add-on**.

*   **Data Protection:** All PII is encrypted at rest. Data minimization principles are core to our data models.
*   **Privacy by Design:** User data erasure requests are automated and comprehensive.
*   **Financial Security:** We are **PCI-DSS compliant via Stripe**. No raw payment data ever touches our servers.
*   **Infrastructure Security:** Private database servers are not publicly accessible. All internal communication is secured via VPN. Mandatory 2FA (TOTP) for all user and admin accounts.

## ü§ñ AI Integration Strategy

AI is not a gimmick; it is a utility to serve our users.

1.  **MVP Priority 1: Multilingual Support Chatbot**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide instant, respectful guidance and build trust. It will answer FAQs, guide users through listing an item, and explain platform policies in their native language.
2.  **MVP Priority 2: Semantic Product Search**
    *   **Purpose:** To allow natural language search ("small oak urn for ashes" or "gold embroidered priest robe") using vector embeddings (`pgvector`).
3.  **MVP Priority 3: Real-time Translation of Listings**
    *   **Purpose:** To break language barriers. A listing posted in Lithuanian will be discoverable and readable by a user in Estonia via automated translation.

---

## üí∞ Monetization Model

Sustainable and fair.

*   **Listings:** The first **10 listings per user per month are free**. This encourages adoption and small-scale participation.
*   **Premium Listings:** Each additional listing costs **‚Ç¨1**.
*   **Transaction Fee:** A **1% fee (minimum ‚Ç¨1)** is applied to the total sale price for every successful transaction processed through the platform's secure payment system.

## üó∫ Roadmap: From Baltics to the EU

1.  **Phase 1 (Now):** MVP Launch in Baltics. Validate core functionality, AI features, and unit economics.
2.  **Phase 2 (Q4 2025):** Expand to Poland, Germany, and France. Integrate local payment methods and postal carriers.
3.  **Phase 3 (2026):** Pan-EU rollout to all 27 member states. Introduction of service listings (e.g., funeral planning, monument engraving).

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why start in the Baltics?**
**A:** It's a strategically perfect test market: three distinct EU countries with different languages, a manageable scale for testing, and a simplified initial GDPR compliance scope.

**Q: How do you handle 27 different VAT rates?**
**A:** Our payment partner, Stripe, automatically calculates, collects, and remits VAT via the VAT MOSS scheme for all EU transactions, eliminating a massive administrative burden.

**Q: Is this platform respectful of religious sensitivities?**
**A:** Absolutely. This is our core principle. Our content guidelines, AI training data, and community policies are being developed in consultation with cultural and religious advisors to ensure a platform that serves with dignity.

**Q: Why open-source parts of the project?**
**A:** We believe in transparency, especially for a project handling sensitive data. Open-sourcing non-core components allows for community audit, builds trust, and fosters innovation. The core marketplace logic will remain proprietary.
