# Project: Journey of Life (JOL) - MVP Architecture for Baltic Launch

**A Pan-European, AI-Powered Marketplace for the End-of-Life Industry**

> **Disclaimer:** This document outlines the technical and strategic blueprint for the Journey of Life (JOL) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is a living document that embodies our commitment to building a platform founded on **trust, technical excellence, and profound respect** for the communities we serve.

## 1. Vision & Mission

*   **Vision:** To become the trusted digital commons for Europe's end-of-life industry, fostering connection, dignity, and accessibility in a traditionally fragmented market.
*   **Mission:** To seamlessly connect suppliers and buyers of church equipment, funeral services, and cemetery maintenance products through a platform that transcends language and borders, powered by ethical AI and unwavering compliance.

## 2. Core Values

*   **Trust & Dignity:** We handle every interaction with the solemnity and respect it deserves.
*   **Transparency:** Clear operations, clear communication, and clear pricing.
*   **Inclusion:** Building for all of Europe's languages, cultures, and faiths.
*   **Technical Robustness:** Security, privacy, and reliability are not features; they are the foundation.

## 3. MVP Scope: Focused Launch in the Baltics

To validate our concept and infrastructure with precision, the MVP will launch in **Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania**.

*   **Target Users:** Churches, Funeral Homes, Cemetery Maintenance Services, Small Entrepreneurs.
*   **Product Scope:** Physical goods across all three core categories (Church, Funeral, Cemetery). Services will be integrated in a future phase.
*   **Key MVP Features:**
    *   Multilingual Listings (EN, LT, LV, ET, RU)
    *   AI-Powered Semantic Search
    *   GDPR-Compliant User Management (Email/Password + 2FA)
    *   Secure Payment Processing (Card, Bank Transfer) via Stripe
    *   Integrated Logistics with DPD
    *   AI-Assisted Support Chatbot

## 4. High-Level Architecture

Our hybrid architecture is designed for security, cost-efficiency, and seamless future scaling.

### 4.2. Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Framework** | Django & Django REST Framework (Python) | Rapid development, built-in security, excellent ORM, and native i18n support. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with PostGIS & pgvector | Relational integrity, geospatial queries, and AI vector search in one battle-tested system. |
| **Frontend** | Next.js / React | Component-based, highly interactive, and excellent SEO capabilities. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Consistent environments from development to production. |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes (GKE) | Automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. |
| **Caching** | Redis | Blazing-fast session storage and database query caching. |
| **Payment Gateway** | **Stripe** | **PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant out-of-the-box.** Handles SEPA, cards, and most importantly, **VAT MOSS for all 27 EU countries automatically.** |
| **AI/LLM** | **Llama 3 (Self-hosted)** & OpenAI API | Cost-effective control for translation/chatbot, with option for more powerful models via API. |

## 5. Compliance & Security: Our Paramount Commitment

*   **GDPR:** Data Protection by Design and by Default. All PII encrypted at rest. Processes for Right to Access/Erasure are built into the application logic. **A Data Protection Officer (DPO) is a required first hire.**
*   **Payment Security:** We are **PCI-DSS compliant by proxy.** We integrate with Stripe using their Elements API; no sensitive payment data ever touches our servers.
*   **Infrastructure Security:** Zero-trust network principles. Private database servers have no public internet ingress. Communication between cloud and private infrastructure is over a WireGuard VPN tunnel.

## 6. AI Implementation Strategy

1.  **MVP Priority 1 (Trust): AI Support Chatbot.** Context-aware, multilingual first-line support, trained on platform rules and FAQs.
2.  **MVP Priority 2 (Discovery): Semantic Search.** Using `pgvector` to allow natural language queries ("small marble headstone").
3.  **MVP Priority 3 (Core Function): Real-time Translation.** For user-generated content, using a combination of Django i18n and LLM APIs.

## 7. Monetization Strategy

*   **Listings:** First 10 listings per month are free. Subsequent listings cost **€1**.
*   **Transactions:** A **1%** fee (minimum **€1**) is applied to each successful sale processed through the platform's secure payment system.

## 8. Roadmap & Next Steps

1.  **Phase 0: Foundation (Current)**
    *   [ ] Appoint Data Protection Officer (DPO).
    *   [ ] Finalize architecture and security audit.
    *   [ ] Provision and harden private infrastructure (Ubuntu servers, VPN).
2.  **Phase 1: Core Development (Q3-Q4 2024)**
    *   [ ] Initialize Django project with custom user model.
    *   [ ] Develop core schemas (User, Product, Order).
    *   [ ] Implement Stripe and DPD API integration.
    *   [ ] Build basic frontend with Next.js.
3.  **Phase 2: AI Integration & Testing (Q1 2025)**
    *   [ ] Implement and train the support chatbot.
    *   [ ] Integrate semantic search via `pgvector`.
    *   [ ] Begin closed beta testing with select partners in the Baltics.
4.  **Phase 3: MVP Launch & Scaling (Q2 2025)**
    *   [ ] Public MVP launch in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania.
    *   [ ] Gather feedback, iterate, and prepare scaling plan for EU.

## 9. Call to Action

We are building more than a marketplace; we are building a community resource.

*   **Developers:** Contribute to an open-source project that matters. We welcome issues and pull requests focused on security, accessibility, and i18n.
*   **Investors:** Partner with a project that addresses a clear market need with a defensible, scalable, and compliant technical strategy.
*   **Industry Partners:** Join our beta program. Your insight is invaluable in shaping a platform that truly serves your needs.

**Let's build a platform worthy of its purpose.**
