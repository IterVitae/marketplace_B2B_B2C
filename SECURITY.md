### üîê Our Security Practices

Our architecture is designed with a "paranoid" compliance-first approach:

-   **Data Encryption:** All user data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest in our databases.
-   **Payment Security:** We are **PCI-DSS compliant** through our partner, Stripe. We never handle or store raw credit card numbers.
-   **GDPR Compliance:** Our system is built with "Data Protection by Design and by Default" principles. We have a appointed Data Protection Officer (DPO).
-   **Infrastructure Security:** Our hybrid infrastructure (Google GKE & private servers) is locked down with strict firewall rules, private networking (VPN), and mandatory multi-factor access for all internal systems.
-   **Rigorous Testing:** Our code undergoes static analysis, dependency scanning, and penetration testing by third-party experts before major releases.

### ‚õ™ A Note for Our Community of Faith
We believe that handling the practicalities of life's journey with dignity requires a foundation of unwavering trust. Our security policy is a core part of our ministry of service. We thank you for your trust and your help in keeping our community safe.
